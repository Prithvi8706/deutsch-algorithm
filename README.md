# Deutsch's Algorithm (Qiskit)

 This is my first quantum computing project using Qiskit! 

I built and debugged this implementation of **Deutschâ€™s Algorithm**, which determines if a function is constant or balanced using quantum principles like superposition and phase kickback.

# Libraries Used 
- Qiskit
- Python
- Google Colab (Jupyter doesnt take qiskit)

# Output
- `0` = Function is constant  
- `1` = Function is balanced
